    "FUD": "FUD opens as fear, uncertainty and doubt. It is a trading strategy of spreading doubt and false information to make investors worried or unsure. So that, FUD changes the way the market feels to bring down prices.\nSpreading such false information about a cryptocurrency system or a certain coin means someone wants to make people scared and doubtful about it. Professional traders usually think that banks and media try to spread false info about crypto to make it difficult to understand.\nWhether it's done on purpose or not, FUD can change the value of a coin or even a whole market. So, don't let FUD bother you, and keep your mind on your plan and don't let fear affect your decisions.",
    "FOMO": "Fear of missing out, or FOMO, is another popular crypto slang term that describes traders' worries about losing profits from rising price. In the world of cryptocurrencies, FOMO is very important because many coins' marketing strategy is based on buyers' hopes that prices will go up.\nAs a result of their worry, people may act in a rush and rely on their investing decisions more on emotion than on logic. FOMO has the potential to significantly affect coin values and generate market volatility. Additionally, it may cause investors to suffer far bigger losses.\nWhen a cryptocurrency is rising, FOMO can lead consumers to make rash investing decisions. For instance, in 2017 FOMO made Bitcoin's value go from about $900 at the start of the year to almost $20,000.",
    "HODL": "\"HODL\" opens as \"hold on for dear life,\" which means not to sell anything, no matter how unstable the situation gets. HODL is used a lot when talking about Bitcoin. If the markets are unstable and your purchases look like they're going up and down there's no reason to panic sell. That's why Hodl offers long-term investments, even when prices are volatile.\nThe first time this crypto slang was used in 2013. A user named GameKyuubi meant to type \"HOLDING\" to let other users know they weren't selling their Bitcoin when the market went down. The misspelling of \"hold\" led to the creation of the crypto slang \"HODL,\" which now means \"keep.\"",
    "Bagholder": "A bagholder is an investor who buys coins at a higher price. They are now stuck with coins that are losing value holding a bag full of coins, but instead of valuable assets, the bag would be full of worthless or falling currencies.\nThey usually hold on to their assets even though their worth keeps going down. They might hold on to their position even if the value of an asset drops to almost nothing, usually because they think the price will eventually rise again or because they don't want to lose.",
    "Mooning": "\"Mooning\" means that the price of a coin or token goes up very quickly. You can also say \"When moon?\" or \"When Lambo?\" to show that you want the price to go up.\nMoonbois are people who are too excited about the future of a coin. These crypto slang words describe investors who are \"pumped\" when the price of a coin is going up. If you hear someone say \"going to the moon,\" or \"to the moon,\" the price will go up. This could be because of marketing or a real rise in value.\nThis idea came from the early days of Bitcoin, when some lucky buyers saw the value of their holdings rise, making them millionaires in a short time.",
    "When Lambo": "\"When Lambo?\" is a half-serious, half-joking question that cryptocurrency investors frequently ask when their cryptocurrency holdings will increase to the point where they can purchase a Lamborghini. In this crypto slang, the ambition to achieve significant financial success is symbolised by purchasing an expensive car.\nPeter Saddington symbolically represented this aim when he bought a Lamborghini with 45 BTC from an earlier investment. The phrase has sometimes been used to make fun of those who enter the cryptocurrency space hoping to make quick cash and ignoring the true worth of currencies.",
    "DYOR": "\"Do your own research\" (DYOR) is a short way to say that you should not take anyone else's financial advice and should study things on your own before investing. Before starting any job, the golden rule says \"Do It Yourself,\" which means just don't trust what other people say. Study, do research, and then make choices based on what you've learnt.\nWith the rise of DYOR after the ICO craze of 2016–2018, experienced traders started thinking how important it is to do a lot of study before investing in any project. This was done to keep newcomers away from scams. People who want to invest should not depend on hype or suggestions from others, but should instead fully research and understand a cryptocurrency or project before investing.",
    "Pump and dump": "Pump-and-dump is when the price of an asset is artificially raised by spreading false information about it. Buying a lot of assets at a low price all at the same time by a lot of people will raise the price and demand of the asset.\nWhen the price suddenly goes up, other people will jump in and buy too. The first group will then sell (dump) the assets to make quick money, leaving those who bought late with big losses.\nPump and dump is considered fraud and is illegal in many places, including the United States. The Bitconnect scam is an example of pump-and-dump because the value of the coin was intentionally inflated, mostly through social media, before the whole platform was revealed.",
    "DeFi": "DeFi stands for \"Decentralised Finance.\" By using blockchain technology, it creates a new financial environment with many different financial tools, apps, and services. This crypto slang covers all of these projects and is getting popular every day.\nDeFi features include stablecoins for banking services, decentralised exchanges, derivatives, prediction markets, and systems for loans and borrowing. In the last one, you can either work with other people or in a pool. In the traditional finance industry, it's a mix of copying goods and services, and blockchain technology make it possible for completely new ones.",
    "Diamond and Paper hands": "People who HODL are said to have \"diamond hands,\" which means they will not sell their stocks for any price. Paper hands or Weak hands, on the other hand, are traders who quickly sell their holdings when prices start to go down.\nNo matter the market conditions, a trader with diamond hands will stay till the end. This crypto slang term refers to a big will to experiment with risk. Diamond-handled traders don't sell their tokens until they think the tokens have hit their full potential. Their decisions are not easily affected by changes in prices, even when the market is bad.\nWhen things start to go wrong, a trader with \"paper hands\" will sell their investment right away. They basically sell in a hurry and their actions might be based on a fear of losing and missing out on possible wins in the future.",
    "Flippening": "The point at which one cryptocurrency is worth more than another is known as \"Flippening.\" For example, when any coin becomes worth more than Bitcoin it will be a flippening. Most of the time, Ethereum has been the second most expensive coin, but its market cap has always been less than Bitcoin's.\nPeople came up with the word \"flippening\" in 2017 to describe a possible change in the biggest coin. It refers to a possible scenario in which Ethereum (ETH) passes Bitcoin (BTC) as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation.\nIn 2018, Charlie Lee came up with the word \"flappening\" to describe Litecoin (LTC) becoming more valuable than Bitcoin Cash (BCH).",
    "Whale": "“Whales” are people or businesses that have a big amount of a certain coin, although there isn't a set number of coins or tokens that someone must hold to be called a whale. So that, the amount of money they have must be large enough to affect market prices if they decide to buy or sell increasing supply or demand. Whales basically have enough money to control the market.\nBecause of this, buyers keep an eye on the industry “whales” to be ready when they make a move.",
    "Cryptosis": "Cryptosis is the feeling of always wanting to know more about blockchain, and coins and how they all work.

    "GMI, WAGMI / NGMI": "Going to make it, Not going to make it, and We're All Going to Make It. All of these crypto slang words are meant to send a positive or negative message.\nGMI became well-known as a way to stay motivated during bear markets when the prices of cryptocurrencies were falling sharply. When things are uncertain, traders would use GMI or WAGMI to support each other and say how sure they are that the community would get through the problems and win in the end.

    "Bear": "When someone says \"the market is bearish,\" they think coin prices will go down, which shows they are not optimistic about how the market will go.\nWhen asset prices fall the market is said to be in a bear mood.
