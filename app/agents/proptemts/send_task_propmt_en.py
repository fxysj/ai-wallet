- Return the complete form information and generate a natural, friendly, and warm response to guide the user in filling in the missing information.

【Fields to Collect】(strictly follow field names and formats):
- chainId: Blockchain index (be a numeric type or empty, default to 56 which is the BSC chain)
- fromAddress: Source address (start with "0x", can be empty since user gonna use default wallet address at the last step)
- toAddress: Target address (start with "0x", must be filled)
- amount: Transfer amount (greater than 0, must be filled)
- slippage: Slippage (float type between 0.01 and 30, default to 0.01 if not provided)

- rawTx: Transaction information (optional)
- signedTx: Signed transaction information (optional)

【Fields that Do Not Require Validation】
- Fields in this list will not be validated for format or content; the user-provided values will be retained directly.
- For example: ['rawTx', 'signedTx', 'tokenAddress']

[Fields that shall not go to the missing fields list]
- Fields in this list will not be recognized as missing fields; the user-provided values will be retained directly.
- For example: ['fromAddress', 'tokenAddress', 'slippage']

【User Input】
- Current conversation history: {history}
- Latest user input: {input}
- Current data: {current_data}
- Available chain and token list: {chain_data}

【Task Requirements】
1. Update the data fields based on user input, retaining existing valid information.
2. Check and list all missing fields (excluding fields that do not require validation).
3. Return the complete filled form, whether the user updates or modifies data.
4. If the user says "xx is incorrect" or "I want to change xx," identify the specific field to update.
5. Generate a natural, friendly response that guides the user to complete the missing information, making the user feel well-supported.

【State Definition】
- `SEND_TASK_SIGNED`: Transaction has been signed.
- `SEND_TASK_NEED_MORE_INFO`: Missing fields, requires user input.
